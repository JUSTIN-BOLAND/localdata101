# What is Local Data 101?

Local Data 101 is an online course/open educational resource/community for preservation advocates, historians, archaeologists, public historians, historic site managers, archivists and anyone interest in local heritage to learn more about data, mapping and visualizations and how to make these things useful for their work, research, scholarship and activism.

We want to teach people how to work with and manage:

- Metadata
- Geography
- Buildings
- Events
- People/Biographies
- Documents

We are not experts—we are still learning too! Join us to share your experiences and help build Local Data 101 – a [Local Preservation School](http://localpreservation.github.io/) project.

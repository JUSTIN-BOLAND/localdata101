# Introduction to Collecting Map Data

# Overview

Just to make sure I've got the right idea, you think this first tutorial should explain:

- Why should historians collect map data from their own research?
- How should historians organize their map data in a structured format?
- How can historians create and edit map data files from scratch?
- How can historians use or adapt existing map data sources?

# Tools for working with map data

Database tools

- [SpatialLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpatiaLite)
- [Spatial data in SQLite](http://blog.perrygeo.net/2008/04/15/spatial-data-in-sqlite/) (2008)
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

Adding geodata

- [geomancer](http://geomancer.io/) - Add geographically-related data to any spreadsheet.

# Organizing map data

How should your data be organized?

- [Data Management for the Humanities](http://guides.library.ucla.edu/data-management-humanities) – UCLA Library Research Guides
- [The Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide) - An exhaustive reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.

How should your data be structured? Consider if there is an open data standard that works for you:

- ...houses? Use the [House Facts standard](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/data-formats/housefacts/)
- ...archaeological resources? Make it compatible with [Open Context](http://opencontext.org/about/services#geojson-ld)
- ...cemeteries? Use the [Open Gravestones](https://github.com/OpenGravestones/OpenGravestones) standard
- ...airports? Use the [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/data/) standard
- ...monuments or murals? Follow the [Cataloging Cultural Objects standards](http://cco.vrafoundation.org/)
- ... etc.

I'm also a bit curious about how preservationists and historians should be using Open Street Map and [Open Historical Map](http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/) as tools for inputting and tracking data about a research topic.

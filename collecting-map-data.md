# Introduction to Collecting Map Data

# Overview

Just to make sure I've got the right idea, you think this first tutorial should explain:

- Why should historians collect map data from their own research?
- How should historians organize their map data in a structured format?
- How can historians create and edit map data files from scratch?
- How can historians use or adapt existing map data sources?

**What is Open Data?**

>Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

So you want to publish some open data? [Simple Open Data](http://simpleopendata.com/) has helpful hints to make it simple and effective.

# Organizing map data

How should your data be organized?

- [Data Management for the Humanities](http://guides.library.ucla.edu/data-management-humanities) – UCLA Library Research Guides
- [The Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide) - An exhaustive reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.

How should your data be structured?

Consider if there is an open data standard that works for you:

- ...houses? Use the [House Facts standard](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/data-formats/housefacts/)
- ...archaeological resources? Make it compatible with [Open Context](http://opencontext.org/about/services#geojson-ld)
- ...cemeteries? Use the [Open Gravestones](https://github.com/OpenGravestones/OpenGravestones) standard
- ...airports? Use the [OurAirports](http://ourairports.com/data/) standard
- ...monuments or murals? Follow the [Cataloging Cultural Objects standards](http://cco.vrafoundation.org/)
- ... etc.
